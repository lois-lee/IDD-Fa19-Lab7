## Part B. Web Camera

**a. Compare `helloYou/server.js` and `IDD-Fa18-Lab7/pictureServer.js`. What elements had to be added or changed to enable the web camera? (Hint: It might be good to know that there is a UNIX command called `diff` that compares files.)**

The file pictureServer.js has the NodeWebcam while server.js does not. It's initialized woth some default options.

The take a picture function is also different.

**b. Include a video of your working video doorbell**
